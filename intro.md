### Projects and Publications

#### Effect of COF for Recognizing Abnormality from Breast Thermograms  
*May 2021, Amrita WNA, India*

- Developed a Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) model to detect abnormalities in chest images using Google Colab. The model was built using images from the publicly available DMR-IR dataset, which were preprocessed with a Co-Occurrence Filter and segmented using an image cropping method in Python. These preprocessed images were then fed into various classifiers, including KNN, SVM, and KMeans. After comparing the outputs, KNN was identified as the best-performing classifier, achieving the highest accuracy of 83.33% in detecting abnormalities.

**Voice Enabled Donation Box**  
*Dec 2018, Amrita HUT Labs, India*

- Developed a donation box that plays a voice message in six different regional languages when someone passes by. The initial implementation used Arduino, but it lacked accuracy. After troubleshooting, the final version was successfully implemented using a Raspberry Pi, which achieved the desired outcome.
