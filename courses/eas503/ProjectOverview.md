## Project Overview

This project focuses on a weather dataset designed for classification tasks. The objective is to predict the weather type (Rainy, Sunny, Cloudy, or Snowy) based on various weather-related features. The dataset is ideal for practicing classification algorithms, data preprocessing, and outlier detection techniques.

## Columns Used

1. **Temperature (numeric)**  
   Represents the temperature in degrees Celsius, with values ranging from extreme cold to extreme heat.

2. **Humidity (numeric)**  
   The percentage of humidity, including potential outliers with values above 100%.

3. **Wind Speed (numeric)**  
   The wind speed in kilometers per hour, with possible unrealistically high values.

4. **Precipitation (%) (numeric)**  
   The percentage of precipitation, including outlier values.

5. **Cloud Cover (categorical)**  
   Describes the level of cloud cover (e.g., clear, partially cloudy, overcast).

6. **Atmospheric Pressure (numeric)**  
   The atmospheric pressure in hPa, covering a wide range.

7. **UV Index (numeric)**  
   Indicates the strength of ultraviolet radiation.

8. **Season (categorical)**  
   The season when the data was recorded (e.g., Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter).

9. **Visibility (km) (numeric)**  
   The visibility in kilometers, including both very low and very high values.

10. **Location (categorical)**  
   Describes the type of location where the data was recorded (e.g., urban, rural).

11. **Weather Type (categorical)**  
   The target variable for classification, indicating the weather type (Rainy, Sunny, Cloudy, Snowy).

## Conclusion

This dataset provides a foundation for exploring classification techniques, handling categorical and numerical data, and managing outliers.
